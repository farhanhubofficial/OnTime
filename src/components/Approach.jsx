            At OnTime Co-working Space, we have a proven track record in delivering client projects to the most demanding of timescales, within budget and with the lowest possible client risk.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-12'>
            All our projects are led by a highly experienced Director and a team with a passion for delivering high-quality line supply and (fix) solutions alongside an excellent level of service.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-12'>
            We adopt a collaborative approach working with the client, interested stakeholders, and our design teams to define a clear brief, which sets out the aims and objectives of the project or client needs; and a programme and budget that is specific and realistic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our approach is to achieve the best balance of quality, cost, function, efficiency, maintainability, and project delivery.
